# proxy-sessions
A proxy for session-typed communication.

To use, first open the server, then the proxy.

In proxy terminal, type "default" if you want to use the default ports for the proxy (7891) and the server (7890, which is translated into the ws://127.0.0.1:7890 URI).

Then open the client.

Then the example server and client will run through the proxy and you can test them out.
